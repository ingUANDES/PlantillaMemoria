  abstract = {We present a set of power investment models, the class of risky capacity equilibrium problems, reflecting different assumptions of perfect and imperfect markets. The models are structured in a unified stochastic Nash game framework. Each model is the concatenation of a model of the short-term market operations (perfect competition or Cournot), with a long-term model of investment behavior (risk neutral and risk averse behavior under different assumptions of risk trading). The models can all be formulated as complementarity problems, some of them having an optimization equivalent. We prove existence of solutions and report numerical results to illustrate the relevance of market imperfections on welfare and investment behavior. The models are constructed and discussed as two stage problems but we show that the extension to multistage is achieved by a change of notation and a standard assumption on multistage risk functions. We also treat a large multistage industrial model to illustrate the computational feasibility of the approach.},

  abstract = {Investment in generation capacity has traditionally been evaluated by computing the present value of cashflows accruing from new equipment in a market with globally optimized capacity mix. The competition and risk that now prevail in the sector may require a more refined analysis. We consider a competitive market with agents investing in some mix of capacities: the risk exposure of a plant and the attitude towards risk of the owner depend on the plant and the portfolio of its capacities. They may also depend on hedging contracts acquired by the investor on the market if such contracts exist. We represent these effects through equilibrium models of generation capacity in incomplete markets. The models come in different versions depending on the portfolio of physical plants and hedging contracts. These modify the long-term risk of the plants, the attitude of the owners towards risk, and hence the incentive to invest. The models involve risk-averse producers and consumers, and their behavior is represented by convex risk measures. We use degree theory to prove existence and explore multiplicity of equilibrium solutions.},

  abstract = {We cast models of the generation capacity expansion type formally developed for the monopoly regime into equilibrium models better adapted for a competitive environment. We focus on some of the risks faced today by investors in generation capacity and thus pose the problem as a stochastic equilibrium model. We illustrate the approach on the problem of the incentive to invest. Agents can be risk neutral or risk averse. We model risk aversion through the CVaR of plants' profit. The CVaR induces risk-adjusted probabilities according to which investors value their plants. The model is formulated as a complementarity problem (including the CVaR valuation of investments). An illustration is provided on a small problem that captures several features of today's electricity world: a choice often restricted to coal and gas units, a peaky load curve because of wind penetration, uncertain fuel prices, and an evolving carbon market. We assess the potential of the approach by comparing energy-only and capacity market organizations in this risky environment. Our results can be summarized as follows: a deterministic analysis overlooks some changes of capacity structure induced by risk, whether in the capacity market or energy-only organizations. The risk-neutral analysis also misses a shift towards less capital-intensive technologies that may result from risk aversion. Last, risk aversion also increases the shortage of capacity compared to the risk-neutral view in the energy-only market when the price cap is low. This may have a dramatic impact on the bill to the final consumer. The approach relies on mathematical programming techniques and can be extended to full-size problems. The results are illustrative and may deserve more investigation.},

  abstract = {A risky design equilibrium problem is an equilibrium system that involves \$N\$ designers who invest in risky assets, such as production plants, evaluate these using convex or coherent risk measures, and also trade financial securities in order to manage their risk. Our main finding is that in a complete risk market---when all uncertainties can be replicated by financial products---a risky design equilibrium problem collapses to what we call a risky design game, i.e., a stochastic Nash game in which the original design agents act as risk neutral and there emerges an additional system risk agent. The system risk agent simultaneously prices risk and determines the probability density used by the other agents for their risk neutral evaluations. This situation is stochastic-endogenous: the probability density used by agents to value uncertain investments is endogenous to the risky design equilibrium problem. This result is most striking when design agents use coherent risk measures in which case the intersection of their risk sets turns out to be a risk set for the system risk agent, thereby extending existing results for risk markets. We also investigate existence of equilibria in both the complete and incomplete cases.},

  abstract = {Capacity expansion models in the power sector were among the first applications of operations research to the industry. The models lost some of their appeal at the inception of restructuring even though they still offer a lot of possibilities and are in many respect irreplaceable provided they are adapted to the new environment. We introduce stochastic equilibrium versions of these models that we believe provide a relevant context for looking at the current very risky market where the power industry invests and operates. We then take up different questions raised by the new environment. Some are due to developments of the industry like demand side management: an optimization framework has difficulties accommodating them but the more general equilibrium paradigm offers additional possibilities. We then look at the insertion of risk-related investment practices that developed with the new environment and may not be easy to accommodate in an optimization context. Specifically we consider the use of plant-specific discount rates that we derive by including stochastic discount rates in the equilibrium model. Linear discount factors only price systematic risk. We therefore complete the discussion by inserting different risk functions (for different agents) in order to account for additional unpriced idiosyncratic risk in investments. These different models can be cast in a single mathematical representation but they do not have the same mathematical properties. We illustrate the impact of these phenomena on a small but realistic example.},

  abstract = {We build a general equilibrium model with endogenous borrowing constraints compatible with credit segmentation. There are personalized trading restrictions connecting prices with both portfolio constraints and consumption possibilities, a setting which has not thoroughly been addressed by the literature. Our approach is general enough to be compatible with incomplete market economies where there exist wealth-dependent and/or investment-dependent credit access, borrowing constraints precluding bankruptcy, or assets backed by physical collateral. To prove equilibrium existence, we assume that both investment on segmented assets is not required to obtain access to credit and transfers implementable in segmented markets can be super-replicated by investing in non-segmented markets. For instance, this super-replication property is satisfied if either (i) all individuals have access to borrow at a risk-free rate; or (ii) financial contracts make real promises in terms of non-perishable commodities; or (iii) promises are backed by physical collateral.},
